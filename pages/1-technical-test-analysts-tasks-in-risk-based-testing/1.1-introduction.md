## Foundation Level Test Process Activities:

- **Planning and Control**: Establishing the framework for what, how, and when to test.
- **Analysis and Design**: Understanding testing requirements and designing test cases.
- **Implementation and Execution**: Setting up testing environments and executing tests.
- **Evaluating Exit Criteria and Reporting**: Determining if testing is complete and reporting findings.
- **Test Closure Activities**: Finalizing and archiving test efforts for future reference.

### Key Points:

- Activities may overlap or occur concurrently.
- Tailoring is often necessary to fit the specific context of the system and project.

## Advanced Level Test Process Refinements:

- **Planning, Monitoring, and Control**: Enhanced focus on tracking and adjusting the test plan.
- **Analysis**: Deepened analysis for understanding complex testing needs.
- **Design**: More sophisticated test case design techniques.
- **Implementation**: Advanced setup of testing environments.
- **Execution**: More detailed execution plans and methods.
- **Evaluating Exit Criteria and Reporting**: Comprehensive evaluation of testing outcomes.
- **Test Closure Activities**: Thorough documentation and archiving practices.

### Enhancements:

- Activities are considered separately for better integration with the software development lifecycle.
- Facilitates more effective test monitoring and control.
