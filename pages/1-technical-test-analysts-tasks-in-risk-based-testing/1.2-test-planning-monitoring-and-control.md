# 1.2.1 Test Planning Summary

## Overview

Test planning is a continuous process that begins with the initiation of the test process for a given test level and extends through to the completion of closure activities for that level. It encompasses the identification of necessary activities and resources to fulfill the test strategy's mission and objectives.

## Key Elements of Test Planning

- **Identification of Activities and Resources**: Determining what is needed to meet the test strategy‚Äôs objectives.
- **Metrics Gathering and Tracking**: Selecting metrics for guiding the project, assessing adherence to the plan, and achieving objectives.
- **Tool Selection, Training, and Documentation**: Using metrics to guide the selection of tools, schedule training, and establish documentation guidelines.

## Strategy and Tasks

- The chosen testing strategy influences planning tasks, such as risk analysis for risk-based testing, which guides mitigating activities and contingency planning.
- Priorities for testing activities are often determined by risk information, e.g., focusing on performance testing where system performance is a high risk.

## Test Manager‚Äôs Role

- Clearly defines the approach to testing, including test levels, goals and objectives of each level, and test techniques to be used.
- Ensures understanding of complex relationships between test basis, test conditions, and tests covering them, which impacts tool decisions and test planning effectiveness.

## Development and Testing Team Coordination

- Emphasizes the importance of tracking relationships between work products from both development and testing teams, such as through traceability matrices.
- May require approval of detailed design documents before beginning test case creation, particularly in non-Agile environments.

## Agile Lifecycle Considerations

- In Agile contexts, informal information transfer sessions may precede testing to facilitate coordination between teams.

## Scope and Test Environment Specification

- Identifies software features within the test scope (and those not within scope) potentially based on risk analysis, with each in-scope feature possibly linked to a test design specification.
- Involves coordination with project architects to define the initial test environment specification, ensuring resource availability, and understanding the cost and timescales involved.

## External Dependencies and SLAs

- Identifies all external dependencies and SLAs, making initial contacts as necessary, including dependencies on outside groups, other projects, external vendors, the deployment team, and database administrators.

# 1.2.2 Test Monitoring and Control Summary

## Purpose of Test Monitoring and Control

Test Monitoring and Control are essential for ensuring that testing aligns with the planned objectives and strategies. This process involves tracking test work products and resources, and implementing corrective actions as necessary to align with the test plan.

## Key Components

- **Testing Schedule and Monitoring Framework**: Establishing a framework to track test work against the plan, including detailed measures and targets.
- **Relating Test Work to Strategic Objectives**: For small and less complex projects, this may be straightforward. However, for more complex projects, detailed objectives and measures are needed for effective monitoring and control.

## Importance of Stakeholder Engagement

- Engaging business stakeholders early can help define relevant measures and targets, influencing testing activities and facilitating better project control.
- Measures and targets based on business cycles or operational needs can provide a more meaningful assessment of progress, especially in projects with little formal documentation.

## Traceability and Transparency

- Proper traceability helps make the relationships between development work products, test basis, and test work products transparent and understandable.
- Reporting on traceability status is crucial for comprehending complex relationships and ensuring relevant stakeholders are informed about testing progress.

## Test Control as an Ongoing Activity

- Involves continuous comparison of actual progress against the plan and executing corrective actions as required.
- Guides testing efforts to meet the project‚Äôs mission, strategies, and objectives, which may involve revisiting test planning activities.

## Influence on Test Planning and Execution

- Detailed planning information is vital for appropriate reactions to control data.
- Test planning documents and control activities should be structured to enable accurate monitoring and facilitate traceability across different test levels.

## Summary

Effective Test Monitoring and Control require a comprehensive framework for tracking progress, engaging stakeholders to define relevant measures and targets, and maintaining traceability. It's an ongoing process that ensures testing activities remain aligned with the project's strategic objectives and can adapt as necessary to meet those goals.
