## Definition and Purpose

Test analysis is a distinct activity in the Advanced syllabi, separate from test design, focusing on defining "what" is to be tested through the identification of test conditions. It aims to create a detailed framework for testing by analyzing the test basis, objectives, and product risks.

## Process and Integration

- Test analysis can occur concurrently, in parallel, or iteratively with test design to produce test work products.
- It starts once the basis for testing at a given level is established, utilizing formal and general analytical techniques.

## Key Considerations in Test Analysis

- **Determining Test Conditions**: Identifying specific conditions to be tested, which should be traceable to the test basis and forward to test designs and other work products.
- **Level of Detail**: The granularity of specifying test conditions is influenced by factors such as testing level, test basis quality, system complexity, project risk, and the development lifecycle.

## Factors Influencing Test Condition Detail

- Testing level and test basis detail.
- System/software complexity and project/product risk.
- Skills and knowledge of the test analysts.
- Test process and organizational maturity.
- Stakeholder availability for consultation.

## Advantages of Detailed Test Conditions

- Enhances flexibility in linking test work products to the test basis and objectives.
- Facilitates early defect prevention and clearer stakeholder communication.
- Directs testing and development activities more effectively.
- Optimizes test design, implementation, and execution for efficient coverage.
- Improves traceability within a test level.

## Disadvantages of Detailed Test Conditions

- Time-consuming to specify.
- Maintenance challenges in dynamic environments.
- Requires a defined level of formality across teams.

## Effective Situations for Detailed Test Conditions

- Use of lightweight test design documentation methods.
- Absence of formal requirements or development work products.
- Large-scale, complex, or high-risk projects requiring robust monitoring and control.

## Situations for Less Detailed Test Conditions

- Component-level testing and less complex projects with simple hierarchical relationships.
- Acceptance testing where use cases facilitate test definition.

Test analysis, by specifying what to test, plays a crucial role in setting the foundation for effective test design and execution, tailoring its approach based on project complexity, risk, and available documentation.
